Python - We are using Python as our primary programming language because it is a simple and straightforward language. 

OpenCV - We are using this computer image library for image processing and computer vision to recognize the tentacles in the images. 

PyQt - We are using this to create a GUI for users to interact with the application. This toolkit is more modern and has more advanced widgets than Tkinter, another popular Python GUI toolkit. PyQt is a very popular UI System for Python, so documentation is easily accessible.

NumPy - We are using this for implementing arrays and counting logic. NumPy uses a lot less memory in comparison to lists. 

**Following our client's requests and needs, we are not using a database or an authentication layer. This may change depending on our client.
